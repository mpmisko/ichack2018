The frontend will communicate with localhost from here. The workflow is the
following: 

---

production

1. make changes to fronted
2. commit and push changes to your dev_frontend branch 
3. git pull from the master branch -- ask about the implemented backend feature
4. http request to localhost
5. push to master once ready

---

development

- backend has a stub endpoint -> localhost/stub. Send requests to this endpoint
to test your frontend implementation. The endpoint returns one of the possible
 3 hardcoded jsons which should be sufficient to create your implementation.

1. git pull the master branch (it has the stub endpoint)
2. request the stub endpoint and wait for response
