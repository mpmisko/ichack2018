The frontend will communicate with localhost from here. The workflow is the
following: 

---

production

1. make changes to fronted
2. commit and push changes to your dev_frontend branch 
3. git pull from the master branch -- ask about the implemented backend feature
4. http request to localhost

---

development

- backend has a stub endpoint -> localhost/stub. Send requests to this endpoint
to test your frontend implementation. The endpoint returns one of the possible
 3 hardcoded jsons which should be sufficient to create your implementation.
Around 18 hours in (after sleep break) we should be looking into marrying the
two.

1. git pull the master branch (it has the stub endpoint)
2. request the stub endpoint and wait for response
